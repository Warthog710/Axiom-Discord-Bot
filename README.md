* Name generation, weather, time-zone conversion...
* Coinflipping
* Automatic roll assigning
* Greeting new users & send server rules on request
* Reminders for a specific user (send reminder via pm)
* Schedule... schedule a guild event which it then posts a reminder at a set time
* Some super secret features...
* Fact checking & moderation via google API(s)
* Some form of cogs support (very much work in progress)
