* Random facts, name generation, weather, time-zone conversion...
* Coinflipping

* Greeting new users & send server roles on request
* Reminders for a specific user (send reminder via pm)
* Schedule... schedule a guild event which it then posts a reminder at a set time
* Some super secret features...
